            Your business is bleeding time, money, and opportunity. Strategy sessions get interrupted by emergencies. 
            You spend tens of hours each week on non-revenue generating work. Crucial sales and client information gets 
            lost in communication. Deals drop off between systems and handoffs.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            You wake up to missed payments and contract problems. There's a constant anxiety of knowing you can't truly disconnect. 
            And perhaps worst of all, you've built a business that demands your presence <span className="font-bold">instead of building your wealth</span>.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Each of these problems compounds the others, creating a cycle of chaos that keeps you trapped in day-to-day 
            operations instead of focusing on growth and strategy. The real cost isn't just the immediate problems—it's 
            the opportunity cost of what you could be doing instead.

            At the end of the day, we care about one thing: <span className="gradient-text">your bottom line</span>. We measure our 
            impact by just two metrics: <span className="underline">SPEED</span> and <span className="underline">MONEY</span>. 
            Our success is tied directly to the revenue we generate for you—not fancy tech implementations or flashy features.
