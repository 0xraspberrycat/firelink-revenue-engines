            Your business is bleeding time, money, and opportunity. Strategy sessions get interrupted by emergencies. 
            You spend tens of hours each week on non-revenue generating work. Crucial sales and client information gets 
            lost in communication. Deals drop off between systems and handoffs. You wake up to missed payments and 
            contract problems. There's a constant anxiety of knowing you can't truly disconnect. And perhaps worst of all, 
            you've built a business that demands your presence instead of building your wealth.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Each of these problems compounds the others, creating a cycle of chaos that keeps you trapped in day-to-day 
            operations instead of focusing on growth and strategy. The real cost isn't just the immediate problemsâ€”it's 
            the opportunity cost of what you could be doing instead.
